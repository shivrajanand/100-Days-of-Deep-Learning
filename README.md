## 📅 What to Expect

Over the next 100 days, I will be consistently working through topics in Deep Learning, including:

- Neural Networks
- CNNs, RNNs, LSTMs
- Transfer Learning
- GANs
- Transformers
- And much more...

Each day, I will share:
- 📓 Jupyter Notebooks
- 📝 Notes
- 📁 Mini Projects or Exercises
- 🧪 Experiments and Learnings
